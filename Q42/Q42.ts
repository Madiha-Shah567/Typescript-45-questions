// 42. Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magician’s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.
// Define the array of magicians
var magicians1= [
    { name: "Harry Houdini" },
    { name: "David Copperfield" },
    { name: "Penn Jillette" }
];
// Function to add "the Great" to each magician's name
function make_great(magicians1) {
    magicians1.forEach(function (magician) {
        magician.name = "the Great " + magician.name;
    });
}
// Function to display the magicians' names
function show_magicians(magicians) {
    magicians.forEach(function (magician) {
        console.log(magician.name);
    });
}
// Call make_great() to modify the magicians array
make_great(magicians1);
// Call show_magicians() to display the modified list
show_magicians(magicians1);
